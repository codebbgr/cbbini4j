# cbbini4j
Refactoring ini4j to work with modules (JDK9+)

# Tools using
* AdoptJDK 14
* Netbeans 11.3

You will need also maven 3.6.3 (download it and change the bundle one on netbeans from settings . It is quite old)

This project is a fork/copy of the original ini4j project at 

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ini4j/

Since it has 5 years to update , I took it over and ported it to module system (jdk9+ ) and fixing some bugz around
